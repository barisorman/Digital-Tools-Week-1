Not only does The Voices cover all the aforementioned ground, but the film also provides insight into mental illness & childhood trauma in an entertaining way. Ryan Reynolds & Anna Kendrick wouldn't especially draw me to a movie, but they did a nice job here, especially Reynolds in his turn as a Dexter-esque dude.
